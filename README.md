# Technical Overview: Kubernetes, Docker, PostgreSQL & Microservices

Welcome!  
This page provides a concise overview of my production experience with Kubernetes, Docker, PostgreSQL, Linux servers, and microservice architecture.

## 🚀 Microservices & Containerization

I work extensively with containerized backend and ML-driven microservices.  
Recent projects include:

### ✔ Python Microservices
- Whisper-based and Vosk-based speech-to-text engines  
- REST APIs with FastAPI  
- CPU-intensive workloads optimized for container environments  

### ✔ ASP.NET Core Backend Services
- Authentication/authorization flows  
- Role-based systems  
- CRUD services with PostgreSQL  
- EF Core migrations and performance tuning  

### ✔ React/TypeScript Frontend (Nginx)
- Built as Docker images  
- Served through Nginx reverse proxy  
- Integrated with API Gateway

## 🧩 Kubernetes Experience (K8s)

### Core components I worked with:
- **Deployments, Services, Ingress**
- **Liveness & Readiness probes**
- **Resource requests & limits**
- **Secrets & ConfigMaps**
- **Environment-specific configuration**

### CI/CD
I implemented automated build & deploy pipelines where:
- Code is built into Docker images  
- Images are pushed to a registry  
- Kubernetes automatically updates to a new version (rolling update)

### Example Architecture

## 🐧 Linux & Docker (DevOps Work)

I deployed and maintained production-ready services on Linux servers.

### 🗂 Nextcloud Deployment on Linux (Docker)
- Docker Compose with Nextcloud + PostgreSQL/Redis  
- HTTPS via Nginx reverse proxy  
- Storage & user policies  
- Backup and long-term maintenance

This strengthened my Linux administration and container orchestration skills.

## 🛢 PostgreSQL Experience

PostgreSQL is my primary database in production projects.

### What I do:
- Schema design  
- Optimizing SQL queries  
- Indexing & analyzing execution plans  
- Transaction handling  
- Connection pooling  
- EF Core & Alembic migrations  

### Used in:
- https://insightscentral.asia — research analytics platform  
- **EduSphere** — platform for teachers and students  
- Various internal systems

### Example (EduSphere DB design):
- Users  
- Roles & permissions  
- Schools & moderators  
- Student accounts created by moderators

## 📊 Kubernetes Skill Rating
**3 / 5** — confident and experienced with deploying microservices & operating K8s environments.

I am continuously growing toward K8s architect-level expertise (advanced networking, operators, cluster design).
